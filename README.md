# Annotorious with Razor Pages and Entity Framework Core Sample
The idea of this sample project is to show how to persist Annotorious annotations to a database using Razor Pages and Entity Framework. It's really simple and both projects are amazing so hopefully this will make it easier for .NET developers to use them!

## Libraries used
* [OpenSeadragon v2.4.2](https://openseadragon.github.io/)
* [Annotorious v2.2.0](https://recogito.github.io/annotorious/)

## Notes
* It's also possible to add a save button and save all annotations changes together depending what you need. For this sample I choose to save with every edit.
* Feel free to contact me here with a PR or in Twitter with any comments you might have in better ways to do improve the JavaScript part of the code which is not my strongest skill.
